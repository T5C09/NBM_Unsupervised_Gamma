# Prerequisites

<details><summary> Summary of prerequisite skills required to succeed in this course (click to expand) </summary>

* Students should be proficient in general python, pandas, and basic visualization libraries -- able to comfortably use these tools in order to explore, analyze, and visualize tabular datasets.
* Students should be comfortable with the mathematics fundamentals of machine learning including calculus, linear algebra, probability, and statistics.
* Students should have at least working familiarity with major topics in supervised machine learning including linear regression, basic classification models, and model evaluation.
* Comfort with web scraping or obtaining data through application programming interfaces (APIs) is a definite plus for expanding the range of possible projects a student can complete, but is not strictly necessary to succeed in the course.

# Learning Objectives

<details><summary> Actionable, assessed learning goals for this course, broken out by category (click to expand) </summary>
  
**Natural Language Processing Fundamentals**

1.  Correctly describe and apply foundational techniques in the quantification of text data including tokenization, vectorization, and the document-term matrix; successfully featurize text data with these methods.
2.  Gain ability to properly and efficiently clean and preprocess text data for quantitative analysis.
 
**Unsupervised Learning Theory**

1.  Precisely describe and differentiate key dimensionality reduction algorithms.
2.  Successfully apply dimensionality reduction algorithms and other modeling techniques to create topic models in language processing.
3.  Gain ability to cluster datapoints using the k-means model along with more specialized techniques, correctly navigating the tradeoffs and best use cases for these different methods.


**Unsupervised Learning in Application**

1.  Develop ability to apply unsupervised learning techniques to a variety of business case studies, with extra focus on natural language processing applications. Successfully compare and contrast these techniques in terms of their algorithmic complexity and data representations, navigating their tradeoffs in order to understand the right technique for the situation.
2.  Gain ability to build recommendation systems using both content-based and collaborative filtering methods, precisely describing the differences and tradeoffs between the two approaches.

# Completion Requirements

In order to successfully complete the course, students are required to:

* Complete a project with a score of 15 or above (refer to the [project introduction](./curriculum/project-introduction/project_intro.md) and [project success guide](./curriculum/project-introduction/project_success_guide.md))

* <details><summary> Receive an average score of at least 60% across the assessments (click to expand) </summary>

   There will be assessments throughout the course (refer to the schedule above); students will be given access to an assessment to complete at that time. Each assessment will consist of 20 multiple choice questions (with four options per question), which students will have 60 minutes to complete. The assessments are open-book.
   
   The assessment will have questions related to the learning objectives detailed above. The objectives give a roadmap of which areas should be focused on in preparation.

### Repo Issues

At Metis, we aim to keep our course content as error-free and seamlessly functional as possible, frequently reviewing and refining it. While we expect that you will find few issues when navigating and using our course repos (either on GitHub or locally), we know we're not perfect. If you encounter issues, it can help you, your peers, future students, and us if you let us know about them by using this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSde-RqyXVR-UXvMbhZSp068__rw--36hrLGPsqtp-XJUDWh5g/viewform?usp=sf_link).
