# Pair Problem

You are given a [CSV file](user_movie_likes.csv) with two columns: UserID and MovieID. Each row lists a user and a movie they liked.

1) Write a function that will take a MovieID and will return three movies that are similar to it (based on the similiarities in user likes).

2) Write a function that will take a UserID and recommend three movies based on what they have liked.

This an open-ended problem. Come up with a simple metric and just code it up. Come see me if you have any Qs!
