Standing for right when it is unpopular is a true test of moral character.” —Margaret Chase Smith\\n\\n“Persons of high self-esteem are not driven to make themselves superior to others; they do not seek to prove their value by measuring themselves against a comparative standard. Their joy is being who they are, not in being better than someone else.” —Nathaniel Branden\\n\\n“Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.” —Soren Kierkegaard\\n\\n“Do what you have always done and you’ll get what you have always got.” —Sue Knight\\n\\n“The happiness of life is made up of the little charities of a kiss or smile, a kind look, a heartfelt compliment.” —Samuel Taylor Coleridge\\n\\n“We avoid the things that we’re afraid of because we think there will be dire consequences if we confront them. But the truly dire consequences in our lives come from avoiding things that we need to learn about or discover.” —Shakti Gawain (The Path of Transformation)\\n\\n“If we become uncomfortable in any given moment, we can look at a flower, a pebble in the street or the tire on our car and be grateful. We can gaze at a person in the distance or at a cloud in the sky and be appreciative. We can smile at a stranger, hug someone we know or tidy a disorganized shelf and be thankful for the opportunity. If we choose gratitude, we will be happy!” —Barry Neil Kaufman\\n\\n“Life isn’t measured by the breaths you take, but by the moments that take your breath away.”\\n\\n“Think of what you have rather than of what you lack.

Was it worth it?”\\n\\n“The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.” —John Milton\\n\\n“Both abundance and lack exist simultaneously in our lives, as parallel realities. It is always our conscious choice which secret garden we will tend...when we choose not to focus on what is missing from our lives but are grateful for the abundance that’s present—love, health, family, friends, work, the joys of nature and personal pursuits that bring us pleasure—the wasteland of illusion falls away and we experience Heaven on earth.” —Sarah Ban Breathnach\\n\\n“The moment one gives close attention to anything, even a blade of grass, it becomes a mysterious, awesome, indescribably magnificent world in itself.” —Henry Miller\\n\\n“God, grant me serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.” —Reinhold Niebuhr\\n\\n“That which does not kill you makes you stronger.” —Neitzsche\\n\\n“Boredom is the feeling that everything is a waste of time; serenity, that nothing is.” —Thomas Szasz\\n\\n“In our daily lives, we must see that it is not happiness that makes us grateful, but the gratefulness that makes us happy.” —Albert Clarke\\n\\n“A man who does simply what is required of him will never know peace; for that, he must do all that he can.”\\n\\n“Look at everything as though you were seeing it either for the first or last time.

Tomorrow is the future. Today is a gift and that’s why we call it the present.”\\n\\n“He who dares nothing need hope for nothing.”\\n\\n“Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs - even though checkered by failure - than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.” —Theodore Roosevelt\\n\\n“A coward gets scared and quits.
