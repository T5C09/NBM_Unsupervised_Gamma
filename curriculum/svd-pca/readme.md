# Sample Lesson Plan

- [Slide deck](SVD_PCA.pdf)
- [PCA code example on MNIST digits](PCA_digits.ipynb)
- (optional) [SVD for image compression](SVD_to_image.ipynb)

# Learning Objectives

Students should be able to:

* Apply decomposition methods to situations that require dimensionality reduction.
  * Make an informed decision about the number of principle components to use.
* Explain the benefits and limits of PCA.
* Be familiar enough with the math behind SVD/PCA to review on their own time.
* Explain the role of variance in PCA.

# Additional Resources

* [Good explanation of how PCA uses eigendecomposition](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3869/what-is-the-intuitive-relationship-between-svd-and-pca)
