# Sample Lesson Plan

[Advanced Clustering](./clustering_advanced.pptx)

# Learning Objectives

Students can
* Compare and contrast different clustering algorithms in terms of
  * Complexity/Scalability
  * Typical application
  * Hyperparameters (including, most importantly, if number of clusters is a hyperparameter or not)
  * Algorithmic gist (students might not be able to whiteboard or code each algorithm, but could give a verbal explanation of how each works).
