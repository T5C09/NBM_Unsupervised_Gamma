    "Before we explore what Surprise has to offer, here's a quick reminder:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender Systems have become ubiquitous in the modern data science landscape, as companies like Google, Netflix, Pandora, and Facebook rely on them to provide targeted content recommendations and create a more enjoyable user experience.  In this lab, we'll focus on the Surprise package.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Collaborative Filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) relies on a ***ratings matrix*** for all items, to generate similarities between items and users based on similar ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Content-Based Filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system#Content-based_filtering) explicitly maps items and/or users into a shared feature space based on explicit user/item characteristics. State of the art recommenders will often rely on hybrid approaches, so seek understand the differences, strengths, and weaknesses of each approach."
