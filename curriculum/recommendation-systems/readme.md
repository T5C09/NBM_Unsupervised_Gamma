# Sample Lesson Plan

- [RecSys Lecture](./what_is_a_recommendation_engine.pdf) 
- [Simple SVD Recommender lab](./simple_SVD_recommender.ipynb) 
- [Surprise lab](./Surprise_lab.ipynb)

# Learning Objectives
- Introduce Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering methods
- Perform Collaborative Filtering from ratings matrices using `pandas` and `sklearn` on movie data
- Understand why this approach represents Collaborative Filtering, how Content-Based would differ, and how it might be implemented in a hybrid approach.
- Use the [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com) library that provides some nice built-in recommender functionality
- Understand how SVDs and other matrix decompositions are employed by recommender algorithms
