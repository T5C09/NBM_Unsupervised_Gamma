- [LSA & NMF Overview + Python Demo](Topic_Modeling_LSA_NMF.ipynb) 
- [LDA Overview + Python Exercise](LDA_Exercise.ipynb)

# Learning Objectives

Students will:
- Understand what "topics" are and where they fit into the data science workflow for
   - EDA: topics changing over time
   - Supervised learning: dimensionality reduction
   - Unsupervised learning: comparing topics between documents
- Understand the difference between LSA, NMF and LDA
   - Latent Semantic Analysis: how it relates to SVD and PCA
   - Non-Negative Matrix Factorization: how it's different from SVD
   - Latent Dirichlet Allocation: how to think in terms of probability distributions
- See how topic modeling works in practice
   - How it is an iterative process
   - How text preprocessing techniques are used to get strong topic vectors
      - Document-Term Matrix vs TF-IDF
      - Stop Words, min_df, max_df
      - Parts of Speech, Bi-Grams, Stemming / Lemmatizing
   - Recognize when topic vectors are "good enough"
